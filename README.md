  Hey there! I'm Nykaj, you may know my other account <a href="https://github.com/nykajak">nykajak</a>, where I do all my personal projects and development. This account is solely to work on my quizzing application (Quake) as part of the App Dev 2 project in the diploma level of the IITM Online BS Degree course. Currently, the repo in question is set to private, but will be updated to be visible to public after development ends and after project submission. All content and code written is by the above user.
